# What is Git?

- was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005
- maintained by Junio Hamano since then
- is a popular **version control system** (VCS)
  - version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.

## Working with Git

- Initialize `git` on a folder, making it a repository
- `git` now creates a **hidden folder** to keep track of changes in that folder
- When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered **modified**
- You select the modified files you want to **stage**
- The staged files are **committed**, which prompts `git` to store a permanent snapshot of the files
- `git` allows you to see the full history of every commit.
- You can **revert** back to any previous commit.
- `git` does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
